<h3>Core4</h3>
<p><em>Conditionals</em> set conditions. If those conditions are met, then the code will continue. For example, if _______, then do X. Else, do Y.
-The following is a snippet of what the code looks like when run through Python from a text based game made in part by me. Some content has been deleted.
<br>

<mark>if user_input == "left":
   <br>
   print()
<br>
elif user_input == "right":
  <br>
  print()
<br>
elif user_input == "Right":
    <br>
    print()
<br>
else:
   <br>
   print("Wrong input. Try again!")</mark>
   
   <br>
   
   -This is a screenshot for what this core looks like in Scratch.

-If you use this function, then it will run it and check whatever you put in the "if". If you wrote "if user_input=="yes": print("No!")". This says that if the user inputs the term "yes", then the program will respond with "No!". Yo could also type "else: print("Yes!"). If the input is anything other than "yes", then the program will respond with "Yes!". Those were examples of how it works in Python. In scratch, it's much simpler but functions the same way.
<br>
<br>
<em>Variables</em> store information. For example, you could write that X=Hello!. Every time you wanted to type Hello! you only have to type it as X.
<br>
-The following is a snippet of how this function looks in the program Python.
<br>
<mark>
print("W_YZ")
<br>
user_input=input()
<br>
if user_input=="X":
<br>
    print("Good job!")</mark>
