<h3>Core4</h3>
<p><em>Conditionals</em> set conditions. If those conditions are met, then the code will continue. For example, if _______, then do X. Else, do Y.
-The following is a snippet of what the code looks like when run through Python from a text based game made in part by me. Some content has been deleted.
<br>

<mark>if user_input == "left":
   <br>
   print()
<br>
elif user_input == "right":
  <br>
  print()
<br>
elif user_input == "Right":
    <br>
    print()
<br>
else:
   <br>
   print("Wrong input. Try again!")</mark>
   
   <br>
   
   -This is a screenshot for what this core looks like in Scratch.

<br>
-If you use this function, then it will run it and check whatever you put in the "if". If you wrote "if user_input=="yes": print("No!")". This says that if the user inputs the term "yes", then the program will respond with "No!". Yo could also type "else: print("Yes!"). If the input is anything other than "yes", then the program will respond with "Yes!". Those were examples of how it works in Python. In scratch, it's much simpler but functions the same way.
<br>
<br>
<em>Variables</em> store information. For example, you could write that X=Hello!. Every time you wanted to type Hello! you only have to type it as X.
<br>
-The following is a snippet of how this function looks in the program Python.
<br>
<mark>
print("W_YZ")
<br>
user_input=input()
<br>
if user_input=="X":
<br>
    print("Good job!")</mark>

<em>Functions</em> are the process of making the code perform a certain task. In Python, it requires the def Func(): command.

     <br>
     This is like Variables, in that you assign the function a task. When this is done, you can simply run that function to execute the entire command.
  <br>
  <br>
    <em>Loops</em> are pretty simple, in that they repeat an action. If you place something inside the loop command, it will be repeated infinitely, for a set amount of time, or until something happens or a goal is reached. 
    <br>
    In Python, a loop looks as follows;

    <br>
    This will loop the command.
